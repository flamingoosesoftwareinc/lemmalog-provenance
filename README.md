# Lemmalog

A Datalog engine for LLM agent memory. This repo contains the engine
(Rust crate, MCP server, REPL, agent skill) plus the design document
([`datalog-context-engine-design.md`](datalog-context-engine-design.md),
with an honest status log of what shipped).

The thesis: **an agent's memory should be a deductive database** — the
agent builds a *verifiable model of what it knows* and mechanically
reasons over how that knowledge changes, rather than "remembering
better" than a vector store. Base facts
are asserted at the ingestion boundary (LLM extraction); rules derive
closures, temporal projections, contradiction candidates, and relevance
diffusion; every fact carries provenance back to its source episodes; and
each conversation turn updates derived views incrementally instead of
re-deriving them (or worse, re-reasoning them in-context).

## What's implemented

| Design element | Status |
|---|---|
| Runtime-parsed, stratified Datalog (interpreter, not proc-macro) | ✅ |
| Negation-as-absence with negative-cycle rejection | ✅ |
| Seminaive fixpoint with per-epoch delta maintenance | ✅ |
| Bi-temporal facts via `valid_from`/`valid_to`/`asserted_at` columns + `now()` | ✅ |
| Semiring annotations: confidence (product t-norm) × provenance (set union) | ✅ |
| Annotation merge on re-derivation (max conf, union prov, deduped supports) | ✅ |
| `why()` proof trees with cycle protection | ✅ |
| Additive arithmetic in comparisons (`D = Dm + 1`) with linear solving | ✅ |
| Scoped negative deltas: retraction recomputes only transitive dependents | ✅ |
| `ask()` — read-only datalog query surface for agents | ✅ |
| Magic-sets demand evaluation (`ask_deep`): point queries without full fixpoint | ✅ |
| Per-position secondary indexes; row-id lookups; WAM-style trail backtracking | ✅ |
| Epoch change-log: `changes_from/since` + "new in memory" context section | ✅ |
| Hybrid retrieval (`context_for_query`): BM25 + entity/graph boosting, budget-aware | ✅ |
| Extraction boundary: `Extractor` trait, memoized `MockExtractor` + `LlmExtractor` | ✅ |
| Deterministic update policy: ADD / UPDATE / NOOP / escalate | ✅ |
| Positional `ContextAssembler` (distilled top, verbatim provenance bottom, budget) | ✅ |
| `AgentMemory` facade: observe → policy → maintain → ask/ask_deep/context/why | ✅ |
| Persistence: snapshot save/load (episodes + EDB facts + rules; derived rebuilt) | ✅ |
| Semantic side index: `Embedder` trait, `HashEmbedder`, `seed_mentions` + `near` diffusion | ✅ |
| DRed-lite scoped recompute: supersession rebuilds only what actually changed | ✅ |
| Synthetic eval harness (`scenario::run_eval`): accuracy/token/latency vs. ground truth | ✅ |
| Aggregation: `count`/`min`/`max`/`sum` head args with group-by fold + value-change propagation | ✅ |
| Entity resolution: star-shaped aliasing, directional canonical views, conflict escalation | ✅ |
| MCP server (`--features mcp`): the engine as tools for Claude Code / Kimi CLI | ✅ |
| Rule registry: versioned batches, agent install/uninstall, backfill on change | ✅ |
| Hypotheticals: `what_if` lookahead with byte-identical store restore | ✅ |
| Streaming change feed: `Added`/`Retracted`/`Cleared` events for projections | ✅ |
| Indexed read paths: `query`/`ask` select buckets (point lookups ~100µs at 4M facts) | ✅ |
| Differential testing: 450 random programs vs a naive fixpoint oracle + parser fuzzing | ✅ |
| REPL: `cargo run --bin lemmalog` (rule / + / ? / ?? / why / run / dump / batches) | ✅ |
| Leapfrog triejoins (worst-case-optimal joins), DBSP streaming deltas | 🚧 future phases |

## Entity resolution (canonicalization)

The LLM proposes star-shaped `alias(Local, Canonical)` edges; Datalog
derives the closure; canonical views project facts read-side only
(`src/canonical.rs`):

```prolog
alias(Acme_Corp, Acme).                       % LLM-proposed, confidence-tagged
same_as(X, Y) :- alias(X, Y).                 % symmetric-transitive closure
same_as(X, Z) :- same_as(X, Y), same_as(Y, Z).
maps_to(X, X) :- entity(X), !aliased(X).      % directional projection:
maps_to(L, C) :- alias(L, C).                 %  exactly one canonical spelling
current_canon(S, R, O) :- current(S, R, O), maps_to(S, S2), maps_to(O, O2).
```

Safety properties (all tested): topology violations — a local with two
canonicals, or a name both local and canonical — derive `alias_conflict`
facts instead of merging identities; confidence propagates through the
closure (weak two-hop merges are visibly low-confidence); retracting an
alias edge collapses the closure and every downstream view in the same
epoch. A similarity-gated LLM reconciliation pass
(`canonical::reconcile::reconcile_entities`) offers only
embedding-similar name pairs to the model.

Building this surfaced and fixed two long-lived engine bugs: the scoped
recompute never processed same-stratum dependents (latent stale-fact
bug), fixed by SCC-condensation stratification plus a recompute
fixpoint; and the invalidation pass ran before lower strata were
materialized on first run, fixed by moving invalidation after
evaluation. Both caught by the differential harness.

## The lemmalog skill

`skills/lemmalog/SKILL.md` teaches agents to use the workspace-scoped CLI as
durable code memory. It queries before normal code discovery, hydrates the
store lazily as facts are verified, and requires commit-pinned provenance in
user-facing answers. It never scans a workspace only to initialize a store.
The binary embeds the matching skill and installs it offline:

```sh
lemmalog skill install                         # ~/.agents/skills
lemmalog skill install --path ~/.claude/skills # another agent
```

Install the `lemmalog` binary first as described under **Install** below.

## MCP server: use from Claude Code or Kimi CLI

```sh
cargo build --release --features mcp
```

Register the server (stdio JSON-RPC, 12 tools):

```sh
# Claude Code (project or user scope)
claude mcp add lemmalog -- $(pwd)/target/release/lemmalog-mcp

# Kimi CLI
kimi mcp add lemmalog -- $(pwd)/target/release/lemmalog-mcp
```

Persistence across sessions: set the environment when registering
(both CLIs support `--env KEY=VALUE` on add):

```sh
claude mcp add lemmalog --env LEMMALOG_MCP_PATH=/tmp/lemmalog.snapshot -- \
  $(pwd)/target/release/lemmalog-mcp
```

The intended division of labor: the host model (Claude/Kimi) reads the
conversation and asserts triples via `lemmalog_observe` (line protocol
`S --rel[conf]--> O`); Lemmalog derives closures, temporal views,
canonicalizations and aggregations deterministically. Typical session:

```
lemmalog_observe      {"facts": "Alice --works_at--> Acme\nAlice --manager--> Bob", "ts": 100}
lemmalog_install_rules {"rules": "reports_to(X,Y) :- current(X,\"manager\",Y).\n trans: ..."}
lemmalog_query        {"goal": "reports_to(\"Alice\", Y)"}        -> Y=Bob, Y=Carol
lemmalog_why          {"fact": "reports_to(Alice, Carol)"}          -> proof tree to episodes
lemmalog_what_if      {"facts": "Dana --manager--> Alice", "goal": "reports_to(\"Dana\", Y)"}
lemmalog_canonicalize {"facts": "Acme_Corp --alias_of[0.9]--> Acme"}
```

Also available: `lemmalog_query_deep` (magic sets), `lemmalog_dump`,
`lemmalog_batches`/`lemmalog_uninstall` (revertable rule batches),
`lemmalog_save`, `lemmalog_run`. Note the goal/fact grammar: bare
capitalized words are variables — quote entity names
(`reports_to("Alice", Y)`).

**Error semantics are built for self-correction.** Recoverable input
errors (unparseable goals, rejected rule batches, unknown batch ids)
return as tool results with `isError: true` — category prefix, the
offending input, the precise reason, and a hint or corrected example
(e.g. the quote-entity-names hint on every parse failure). Silent
zero-fact ingestion is impossible: `lemmalog_observe` reports every
dropped line with its reason (pronoun/role-word subjects, prose
contamination, missing `--rel-->` structure), so a malformed extraction
batch is loud, not lost.

## LongMemEval (oracle split) — live results

The 15 MB oracle split is not committed; download it once:

```sh
mkdir -p data && curl -sL \
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaowu0162/longmemeval/resolve/main/longmemeval_oracle \
  -o data/longmemeval_oracle.json
```

`examples/longmemeval.rs` runs the benchmark end-to-ready: evidence
sessions -> chunked live extraction -> update policy -> memory -> answers
in two modes (structured memory block vs raw transcript, same model) ->
SQuAD-style F1. Final configuration: Claude Opus 4.8, 5 per type, with
role-aware pronoun resolution, stated-date extraction feeding derived
ordering rules, answer-format discipline, and a question-time recall
fallback:

```
                         memory F1   transcript F1   EM
single-session-user   5/5  0.80          0.80       4/5 vs 4/5
knowledge-update      5/5  0.60          0.41       3/5 vs 1/5
multi-session         5/5  0.21          0.38       0/5 vs 1/5
temporal-reasoning    5/5  0.57          0.61       2/5 vs 2/5
single-session-assistant  0.64          0.74       2/5 vs 2/5
single-session-preference 0.06          0.13       0/5 vs 0/5
OVERALL               30    0.48          0.51      11/30 vs 10/30
```

(One scored run — see the measurement caveat in the retrieval-results
section before quoting these numbers comparatively; run-to-run variance
without temperature control is ~±0.3 F1 per type at n=5.)

Per-fix effects, measured on the failing instances before the full run:

- **Role-aware pronoun resolution** (the assistant's "I" was being
  rewritten into the user's voice by our own speaker instruction): the
  Roscioli recommendation question went 0.00 across three runs -> exact
  match. single-session-assistant F1 0.44 -> 0.64.
- **Answer-format discipline** ("ONLY the answer entity, no derivation")
  plus stated dates and rule-derived ordering (`dated` rules generated
  from date-shaped relations, `happened_before` derived by comparison
  rules, stated `before` made transitive): the bike-vs-car question went
  0.15 (right answer wrapped in prose) -> exact match; temporal-reasoning
  0.42 -> 0.57.
- **Recall fallback** (on "unknown"-shaped answers, one targeted
  extraction pass over the retained episodes, then re-answer): triggered
  correctly but rescued nothing in this run — the residual misses
  ("hoping to beat my best of 25:50") resist even question-informed
  extraction. Kept: it is architecturally right and free when unused.

Honest trade-off now visible in the data: richer extraction grows memory
contexts (dated facts, assistant facts), compressing the token advantage
from 4-12x to 1-5x on heavy instances — recall vs context size is a dial,
not a free lunch. The stable per-type structure across five full runs:
knowledge-update is the memory's decisive category (transcript answers
stale values or hedges both), user-stated discrete facts are near-perfect,
preference gold answers are unmatchable prose for both modes, and the one
remaining frontier is indirect mentions.

## Hybrid retrieval (`src/retrieval.rs`)

The answer to the trade-off above: **selection, not extraction, is the
bottleneck at the context boundary.** `AgentMemory::context_for_query`
replaces dump-everything assembly with a three-signal ranker:

- **BM25** (in-crate, no dependencies) over rendered facts *and* verbatim
  episode text — exact keyword grounding, including entities and relation
  words the question uses.
- **Entity-match boosting** — the graph half: a query naming an entity
  pulls that entity's facts (+1.5) and one-hop co-occurring entities'
  facts (+0.4), even with zero keyword overlap on relation words.
- **Budget-aware positional assembly** — ranked facts fill 60% of the
  token budget, their provenance episodes plus BM25-top episodes fill the
  rest verbatim (char-safe truncation), distilled-first / sources-last.

Selection is O(facts) per query — rebuild-on-demand is fine at agent
scale — and the internal bookkeeping relations (canonicalization plumbing,
aggregation temps, entity seeds) are excluded. The LongMemEval runner now
answers from retrieved context (question-relevant facts + dated edge
history only for the entities the selection touches), and the MCP server
exposes it as `lemmalog_context` — the skill teaches it as the default
over `lemmalog_dump` for grounded answering.

## Retrieval results (live, same 30-instance protocol)

Memory-mode context switched from dump-everything to
`context_for_query` (1800-token budget, budgeted dated-history append).
Assembled from focused runs (Claude Opus 4.8):

```
                         memory F1   transcript F1
knowledge-update      5/5  0.80          0.57
single-session-user   5/5  ~1.00         ~0.80
single-session-assistant  0.70          0.74
multi-session         5/5  0.32          0.33
single-session-preference 0.11          0.11
temporal-reasoning    5/5  high variance (see below)
```

**Measurement caveat, learned the hard way**: opus-4-8 rejects the
`temperature` parameter, so answers sample at the API default — a single
scored run at n=5/type has ~±0.3 F1 noise per category (the bike-vs-car
question flipped 1.00 → 0.00 across two same-configuration runs). Type
comparisons below ~0.3 are not evidence. The findings that held across
every configuration:

- **Knowledge-update is consistently ahead**: 0.80 vs 0.57 in the
  retrieval configuration, including the indirect-mention 5K question
  answered for the first time in six runs; the transcript baseline
  answers with stale values or hedges both.
- **User-stated discrete facts are near-perfect** for memory across all
  configurations, including instances the transcript mode misses.
- **Token economics hold**: 1.3-6x smaller contexts, precision-vs-latency
  is an explicit dial (tighter contexts trigger more recall fallbacks).
- **Temporal-reasoning is unresolved, with the failure fully attributed**:
  ordering questions need both endpoints' dated facts; when extraction
  captures both (verified by grepping the extraction cache), retrieval
  delivers them and the answer is exact — the residual failures are
  extraction recall (events never extracted as facts) plus answer-sampling
  variance. Fixing measurement needs n≥10 or repeated runs, which the
  extraction cache makes cheap (answers-only cost).

**Reproduction is nearly free after the first run**: `LEMMALOG_CACHE_DIR`
persists extraction results by episode hash (reruns pay only for
answering), `LEMMALOG_DUMP_CTX` + `LEMMALOG_NO_ANSWER=1` assemble and
dump contexts with zero API calls — context-assembly changes can be
validated offline by diffing the dumped files.

## MemEval: the standardized comparison (102 questions, split s)

The headline run: [ProsusAI MemEval](https://github.com/ProsusAI/MemEval)'s
stratified 102-question LongMemEval protocol (17 per category, the `s`
haystack, ~50 sessions per question) with their standardized reader
(gpt-4.1) and native binary judge (gpt-4o). Lemmalog plugged in as an
adapter; extraction is Claude Sonnet 4.6 (ingestion is architectural,
like Memory-R1's local model), chunked, file-cached. Published numbers
are F1 on their leaderboard.

```
System              F1 (answer tokens)
PropMem (pub)        0.550   (23.1M all-phase)
SimpleMem (pub)      0.480   (20.8M all-phase)
lemmalog             0.463 ± 0.010 (3 runs)  (280K answer-phase)
OpenClaw (pub)       0.244   ( 0.7M)
fullcontext (ours)   0.197   (10.6M)
fullcontext (pub)    0.222   (10.6M)
```

Binary accuracy 0.575 ± 0.004 (3 runs, gpt-4o judge). Per-category
(single run, F1 / accuracy):

```
Single-Session User         0.790 / 0.941
Knowledge Update            0.579 / 0.647
Single-Session Assistant    0.672 / 0.882
Temporal Reasoning          0.416 / 0.412
Multi-Session               0.211 / 0.353
Single-Session Preference   0.128 / 0.235
```

Reading it honestly:

- **F1 0.463 ± 0.010 (3 runs), accuracy 0.575 — 2.4x our own
  full-context run (0.197) on the same questions** — at 1/40th the
  answer-phase tokens. Statistically at SimpleMem's published 0.480;
  PropMem (0.550) still ahead.
- **The improvement arc is the story**: the first configuration scored
  F1 0.226; diagnosing the actual wrong answers and shipping targeted
  fixes — counting aggregates via the aggregation engine, terse-answer
  prompts, a question-targeted recall fallback, then count sections with
  member enumeration (fixed by a plural-stemming hole: "owns" never
  matched "own", silently dropping every count line), a reference-date
  anchor, and precomputed date arithmetic — more than doubled F1:
  knowledge-update 0.218 → 0.579, user-facts 0.359 → 0.790,
  multi-session 0.013 → 0.211, temporal 0.373 → 0.416.
- **Abstention semantics are a cross-benchmark tension, measured**: a
  strict "refuse unless directly stated" reader won LoCoMo's adversarial
  category (false-premise questions) but collapsed LongMemEval to 0.371
  — 31% of its questions are aggregation ("which airline most?",
  "how many subscriptions?") that no single fact states, and strict
  refusal scored them all zero. The shipped policy refuses only
  misattribution or absent subjects and *synthesizes* (count, compare,
  combine dates) when evidence exists.
- **Date arithmetic belongs to the engine**: the reader reliably states
  both dates and then fails to subtract, so the context now carries a
  CURRENT DATE anchor (relative time like "two weeks ago" was
  unanchored) and DATE FACTS with differences precomputed
  (`days_from_civil` over extracted `*_on` dates).
- **The remaining gap is characterized**: preference questions stay
  low (unmatchable prose golds, both modes); some multi-session targets
  were never extracted (the Airbnb booking produced zero facts — an
  extraction-recall bound, not a retrieval one); money amounts are not
  extracted as numbers, so per-group sums are out of reach without
  re-extraction.
- **Token economics**: ~2.7K answer-phase tokens per question vs ~100K
  for full context; extraction is paid once per conversation (~$0.20
  Sonnet, cached forever) and amortizes across every additional
  question.

## LoCoMo: the second standardized benchmark (10 conversations, 1,986 questions)

Same harness, LoCoMo's standardized gpt-4.1-mini reader. F1 vs. their
published leaderboard:

```
Rank  System          F1      Tokens (all-phase)
 1    PropMem (pub)   0.605     5.9M
 2    OpenClaw (pub)  0.557    16.4M
 3    FullCtx (pub)   0.542    37.5M
 —    lemmalog        0.533 ± 0.001 (3 runs)  6.8M
 4    Hindsight(pub)  0.489    24.2M
 5    Graphiti (pub)  0.416     5.1M
 6    Memory-R1(pub)  0.389     3.4M
 7    SimpleMem(pub)  0.358    11.4M
```

**3rd of 10**, ahead of Hindsight, Graphiti, Memory-R1, SimpleMem, Mem0,
and MemU at 1/4th-1/6th their token spend, behind only PropMem and
OpenClaw. Run-to-run σ is 0.001 (three full 1,986-question runs); the
cross-conversation spread (±0.03) is the honest single-run uncertainty.
The jump from 0.483 came from five retrieval-side upgrades (extraction
re-run; same reader, same judge):

1. **Temporal normalization** — the extractor emits `YYYY-MM-DD`-form
   date objects, the ingester lowers them to comparable integers
   (`dated`), and `happened_before` derives from real time instead of
   symbol-interning order (a latent bug: the engine's `<` on symbols
   compares intern ids, not text). Temporal F1 0.257 → 0.447.
2. **Entity reconciliation, wired** — `canonical::reconcile` existed but
   nothing called it. One LLM pass per conversation asserts
   confidence-tagged `alias` edges (candidates: substring,
   same-(subject,relation) co-objects, embedding-similar); the Datalog
   closure derives `same_as`, retrieval bridges adjacency through the
   clusters, and high-confidence merges render for the reader.
3. **Embedding rerank fused into retrieval** — local nomic embeddings,
   cosine above a noise floor added to BM25 + entity boosts; facts with
   zero lexical overlap with the question ("kitchen gadget" ↔ "Instant
   Pot") now surface.
4. **Explicit abstention** — the reader checks the question's premise
   (who the facts are about) and refuses with "Not mentioned" when the
   subject is absent or the premise misattributes; when evidence exists
   but no single fact states the answer, it synthesizes (count, compare,
   combine dates). Refusal is final — no recall fallback after a
   deliberate abstention. Adversarial F1 0.676 → 0.707 (see the
   LongMemEval section for why the stricter version was walked back).
5. **Count sections with members + a date anchor** — count aggregates
   render with their member lists (variant-merged), every context opens
   with the CURRENT DATE, and date-shaped questions get DATE FACTS with
   differences precomputed. The counting path had been silently dead on
   LongMemEval: the relevance filter's plural stem only folded words
   longer than 4 chars, so "owns" never matched "own" and every count
   line was dropped.

Per-category (before → after):

```
                    before  after   PropMem  FullCtx
Multi-hop (N=841)    0.544   0.545    0.599    0.674
Adversarial (N=446)  0.676   0.707    0.794    0.509
Factual (N=282)      0.368   0.399    0.431    0.517
Temporal (N=321)     0.257   0.454    0.615    0.369
Inferential (N=96)   0.143   0.164    0.289    0.197
```

Notable: **adversarial 0.707 beats full-context (0.509) by +0.20** —
those are questions designed to bait false memories (misattributed
premises: "what was grandma's gift to Melanie?" when the gift story is
about someone else), and the structured memory says "no" honestly rather
than confabulating from loose retrieval.

Two benchmark rows, both on their standardized harnesses, both with
repeated measures: LongMemEval F1 0.463 ± 0.010 / accuracy 0.575 ± 0.004
(at 1/40th the tokens) and LoCoMo F1 0.533 ± 0.001 (3rd of 10). The
consistent pattern: competitive with the leaders on structure-rewarding
categories, ahead of every retrieval-first system, behind PropMem
overall.

## Token economics (the honest numbers)

**Per-question context** (what actually hits the reader's prompt):

```
LongMemEval:  ~2,300 tokens/question vs ~104,000 for full context = 45x
LoCoMo:       ~3,200 tokens/question vs ~18,900 for full context =  6x
```

**All-in cost** (reader + one-time extraction, benchmark accounting):

The benchmarks are actually the *worst case* for amortization —
LongMemEval gives each question a fresh conversation (extraction never
reuses). LoCoMo (10 conversations, ~200 questions each) shows the real
curve:

```
questions asked     all-in (ours)    all-in (fullctx)    ratio
        ~100            ~1.5M              ~1.9M          1x (crossover)
        200             ~1.8M              ~3.8M          2x
      1,986             ~7.6M             ~37.5M          5x
```

**Real agent scenario** (one growing conversation, queried every turn):

```
after  50 turns:  fullctx = 100,000 tok/q | lemmalog = 2,500 tok/q (40x)
after 100 turns:  fullctx = 200,000 tok/q | lemmalog = 2,500 tok/q (80x)
                  (fullctx OVERFLOWS a 128K window here)
after 500 turns:  fullctx =   1.0M  tok/q | lemmalog = 2,500 tok/q (400x)
```

Lemmalog's per-question cost is **constant** (~2.5K tokens) regardless
of history length; full-context grows linearly and overflows. The
extraction cost is proportional to *new input* (you only pay for what
you read once), not to *queries*. For a long-running agent, the
cumulative ratio reaches 150x by turn 500 — and the agent never runs
out of window.

## Correctness assurance## Correctness assurance

`tests/differential_test.rs` generates 450 random stratified programs
(range-restricted rules, EDB-only negation with constant arguments) and
compares the engine against a dead-simple brute-force fixpoint oracle over
the ground domain — the classic validation technique for Datalog engines —
plus an incremental-vs-single-shot equivalence check and a 2000-case
parser fuzz. This harness caught a real soundness bug: cross-run growth
of a predicate that a rule reads *negatively* never invalidated that
rule's earlier derivations (within one run, stratum ordering already
guaranteed soundness). Additions to negated predicates now trigger the
DRed-lite scoped recompute via the change-log window; regression-tested.

## Aggregation

Aggregated head arguments, lowered internally to a temp relation plus a
group-by fold (the design doc §3.3's Flix-style monotone aggregates):

```prolog
kit_count(Person, count(Kit)) :- bought(Person, Kit).
stats(Person, count(Kit), max(Rating)) :- bought(Person, Kit, Rating).
big_spender(Person) :- kit_count(Person, N), N >= 3.
```

Semantics and guarantees:
- Group key = the non-aggregated head prefix; each `count/min/max/sum`
  folds a column over the group's distinct body solutions
  (`count` is COUNT-DISTINCT by set semantics).
- **Strict stratum ordering**: aggregated predicates complete their
  fold before any reader evaluates — enforced by treating aggregation
  dependencies like negation edges in the stratification, with
  recursion through an aggregated head and mixed ordinary/aggregated
  definitions of one predicate rejected at install time.
- **Value changes propagate**: growth increments the fold
  (2 -> 3 flips `big_spender`) and retraction decrements it; replaced
  values retract-and-reinsert, and the DRed-lite cascade recomputes
  downstream readers within the same epoch.
- `why()` on an aggregated fact shows the rule and a contributing row
  witness (`via agg:kit_count`).

Benchmark note: wiring dynamic per-relation counting rules into the
LongMemEval runner (`LEMMALOG_COUNTS=1` to enable) did **not** fix the
counting questions — the bottleneck there is extraction recall (items
mentioned in conversation that never become facts), and the extra
count rows added context noise. The engine feature is correct and
tested; the honest finding is that counting questions need better
extraction, not aggregation.

## Rule language

```text
# temporal projection: what's true now
current(E,R,O) :- edge(E,R,O,VF,VT,_), now(T), VF =< T, T < VT.

# transitive closure
reports_to(X,Y) :- current(X,"manager",Y).
trans: reports_to(X,Z) :- reports_to(X,Y), reports_to(Y,Z).

# stratified negation
orphan(E) :- entity(E), !current(E,_,_).

# bounded relevance diffusion; conf = product of edge confidences = decay
near(S,E,1) :- mentions(S,E).
diffuse: near(S,E2,D) :- near(S,E1,Dm), Dm < 3, D = Dm + 1, edge2(E1,E2).
```

- Variables are uppercase; `"strings"` and integers are constants; `_` is a
  wildcard.
- `name:` prefixes label rules (shown in `why()` output).
- Builtins: `now(T)`, comparisons (`<  =<  >  >=  =  \=`), integer `+`/`-`.
- Recursion through negation is rejected at install time.

## API

```rust
use lemmalog::{Engine, Ann, Value};

let mut e = Engine::new();
e.install_program("current(E,R,O) :- edge(E,R,O,VF,VT,_), now(T), VF =< T, T < VT.")?;
e.declare("edge", &args, Ann::base(0.9, ["ep42"])); // extraction boundary
e.set_now(100);
e.run();                                        // incremental fixpoint
e.run();                                        // == 0: no delta, no work
e.query("current", &[Some(alice), None, None]); // pattern query
e.why("current", &args);                        // provenance proof tree
```

## Incremental maintenance model

Each `run()` is an epoch. Facts asserted since the last epoch form the
delta seeds; seminaive evaluation fires each rule once per positive body
atom bound to the delta (complete for set semantics), iterating to fixpoint.
A `run()` with no new assertions derives nothing. Retraction (supersession)
is a scoped negative delta: only derived predicates that transitively read
the retracted predicate are cleared and re-derived; everything else keeps
its incrementality. Every new fact is logged with its epoch
(`change_log`), backing "what changed in memory" reporting.

Performance notes: per-position hash indexes are maintained eagerly on
insert/remove and back *every* read path — rule-body joins (`lookup`
returns row ids), `query()`, and `ask()` all select the smallest bucket
instead of scanning (ground point lookups: 230 ms -> 92 µs over a 3.9M-fact
relation). Rule bodies backtrack via an undo trail rather than environment
clones; provenance witnesses per fact are capped (`SUPPORT_CAP`) — `why()`
needs one derivation, not the exponentially many paths. On an M-series
laptop, a 500-node chain closure (124,750 facts) fixpoints in ~17 s while
an incremental turn costs ~50 ms and an idle turn microseconds — the
incremental/idle contrast is the design's claim.

Cyclic-join evidence (`examples/graph_queries.rs`, 2,000 nodes / 8,000
arcs): triangle detection — the query class where worst-case-optimal joins
matter — is cheap here (the sparse-graph buckets keep the nested-loop
evaluator near-linear), while materializing a full transitive closure
dominates everything (3.9M facts, ~67 s) — an argument *against* blindly
materializing dense closures and for demand queries (`ask_deep`), not for
triejoins at agent-memory scale. Leapfrog triejoins remain the documented
path for dense-relation joins at much larger scale.

## Agent layer (`src/agent.rs`)

The LLM sits strictly at the extraction boundary; the fixpoint is pure.

```rust
use lemmalog::{AgentMemory, MockExtractor};

let mut m = AgentMemory::new(MockExtractor::new(0.9), "reports_to(X,Y) :- current(X,\"manager\",Y).")?;

let r = m.observe_at("alice --works_at--> acme", 100); // ADD (extractor boundary)
let r = m.observe_at("alice --works_at--> gigant", 200); // deterministic UPDATE (supersede)
let r = m.observe_at("alice --likes--> bob", 300); // non-exclusive: ADD + escalation
m.maintain(200);                                     // incremental re-derivation
m.ask("current(\"alice\", \"works_at\", O)")?;        // ["O=gigant"]
m.context(&["alice"], 200);                          // positional assembly, budgeted
m.why("current(alice, works_at, gigant)")?;          // proof tree -> episodes
```

- **Update policy** (Mem0-style, deterministic-first): no open fact → ADD;
  same fact → NOOP (annotation merge); exclusive predicate with different
  object → UPDATE (close old interval, assert new); otherwise → ADD +
  escalation for the agent to resolve.
- **Context assembler**: a leading "new in memory since last turn" section
  (from the epoch change-log), then distilled facts sorted by confidence at
  the top of the window, verbatim source episodes (from provenance) at the
  bottom — the lost-in-the-middle mitigation — under a token budget
  (60/40 split, chars ≈ 4×tokens).
- **`ask(goal)`**: read-only, side-effect-free atom query returning variable
  bindings; the datalog-as-tool surface. **`ask_deep(goal)`** answers the
  same shape via magic-sets rewriting: only the demand-relevant slice is
  derived (adornment + magic predicates, left-to-right binding passing),
  the base store is untouched, and `engine.last_demand_facts` reports the
  slice size.
- **`LlmExtractor`**: extraction behind a caller-supplied model call (any
  provider — or a test closure). Lemmalog owns the prompt, the
  `S --rel[conf]--> O` response protocol, memoization by episode id, and
  degradation-to-zero-facts on provider errors.
- **Persistence** (`save`/`load`): tab-separated snapshots of rules, clock,
  episodes (verbatim sources), escalation queue, and base facts with
  annotations. Derived relations are never persisted — they are rebuildable
  projections, recomputed on load (event sourcing, per the design doc).
- **Semantic retrieval** (`semantics` module): a `SemanticIndex` of entity
  embeddings behind an `Embedder` trait (`HashEmbedder` for offline/test);
  `seed_mentions` asserts `mentions(S, entity)` facts with cosine
  confidence, and `RELEVANCE_RULES` diffuse them over `links` edges with
  t-norm decay — the hybrid vector + symbolic half of the design.
- **Rule registry** (`install_rules`/`uninstall_rules`/`rule_batches`): rule
  programs install as versioned batches an agent can revert. Installing or
  uninstalling marks the program dirty: the next `run()` clears derived
  relations (including orphans of uninstalled rules) and backfills every
  rule against the existing store — rules installed mid-session fire
  against old facts (this was a real gap: evaluation previously reacted
  only to pending deltas).
- **Streaming change feed** (`Engine::changes_since(checkpoint)`): every
  addition, explicit retraction, and wholesale clear (scoped/program
  recompute) is stamped with an epoch. Checkpoint at `epoch()` after a run
  and an external projection — a vector index, a UI, a downstream agent —
  receives exactly the next turn's window. `Cleared(pred)` is the signal
  to re-sync a derived predicate from scratch.
- **Hypotheticals** (`Engine::hypothetical` / `AgentMemory::what_if`): the
  lookahead primitive from design §4.5 — assume temporary facts, run to
  fixpoint, answer a goal, restore the store byte-identically (relations,
  change log, epoch, dirty flags). `what_if(text, goal)` runs an episode
  through the extractor under a `hyp-` id (never colliding with real
  episodes) and reports what the assumption would add.
- **Retraction cost**: supersession uses a DRed-lite scoped recompute —
  dependents are cleared level by level in stratum order, and a level is
  only rebuilt-and-propagated-into if its input's key set actually changed.
  A `works_at` supersession rebuilds `current` (linear) and leaves a
  manager-only closure untouched.

## Install

With a current Rust toolchain and Cargo:

```sh
cargo install \
  --git https://github.com/flamingoosesoftwareinc/lemmalog-provenance.git \
  --bin lemmalog \
  --locked
lemmalog help
```

Optionally install the embedded agent skill. The default is user-global;
`--path` selects another agent or a repository-local skills directory:

```sh
lemmalog skill install
lemmalog skill install --path /workspace/.agents/skills
```

Cargo installs the executable under `$CARGO_HOME/bin` (normally
`~/.cargo/bin`), which must be on `PATH`.

## Run

### Workspace CLI

The `lemmalog` binary is also a one-shot, workspace-aware CLI. Pass a file or
directory inside any Git checkout. Without configuration, its Git root is an
isolated workspace, preserving repository-scoped behavior. For a workspace of
multiple repositories, add this marker at their common ancestor:

```toml
# .lemmalog
id = "company-platform"
```

Resolution uses `--workspace <path>`, the nearest ancestor `.lemmalog`, or the
Git root fallback, in that order. Marked workspaces use one durable snapshot;
facts retain workspace or repository scope within it.

```sh
lemmalog observe /work/payments/src/db.rs \
  'payment_service --uses--> postgres' \
  --ts 100 --provenance 'https://github.com/acme/payments/blob/abc123/src/db.rs#L20-L35' \
  --captured-at 2026-08-29T19:42:00Z
lemmalog query /work/payments 'current("payment_service", "uses", O)'
lemmalog why /work/payments 'current(payment_service, uses, postgres)'
lemmalog observe /work/payments 'PaymentSettled --means--> completed_payment' \
  --scope workspace --provenance 'git://payments/abc123/events.go#L10-L18'
lemmalog query /work/payments \
  'flow(S) :- current("payments", "emits", E), current(E, "handled_by", S)'
```

Observations default to repository scope. Queries see the resolved workspace by
default; `--scope repository` selects the target repository plus shared
workspace facts, and `--scope workspace` selects shared facts only. Each
invocation loads one snapshot, performs one operation, saves mutations, and
exits. Capture timestamps are kept in a sidecar. Provenance values remain
opaque, so GitHub, Git, local files, LSP locations, and other evidence schemes
can be supplied by callers. Prefer host-generated, commit-pinned permalinks that
open the exact cited source; GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and editor URL formats
differ. Stores live under the user data directory, outside the workspace.

```sh
cargo run --bin lemmalog          # interactive REPL (or pipe a script)
cargo test                         # 44 tests: engine (20) + agg (6) + agent (10) +
                                   # differential (3) + semantics (2) +
                                   # eval (2) + session (1)
cargo run --example agent_memory   # engine-level demo
cargo run --example agent_session  # full agent loop incl. ask_deep + news
cargo run --release --example investigation # the thesis in one run: derived
                                   # beliefs, why() proofs, retraction
                                   # repairs the closure
cargo run --release --example graph_queries # cyclic joins + closure stress
cargo run --release --example perf        # chain closure: fixpoint vs incremental
                                   # vs idle turn timings
cargo run --release --example eval # synthetic long-horizon eval report
```

### Synthetic long-horizon eval (seed 42, 1000 turns, 30 people)

```
knowledge updates   : 30/30 correct (220 supersessions applied)
multi-hop reasoning : 40/40 correct (magic-sets ask_deep, 7.6 ms total)
conflict abstention : 29/29 conflicted people keep ALL open preferences
overall accuracy    : 100.0%
token economics     : 422 ctx tokens vs 5386 transcript tokens (12.8x saving)
maintenance latency : 1.5 ms/turn
```

The deterministic memory behaviors LongMemEval shows frontier models fail
(knowledge updates, temporal projection, multi-hop, abstention) are exact
here because they are rule-derived. The harness (`scenario` module) also
caught two real engine bugs during development: a `swap_remove` corruption
in retraction (resurrected facts, silent neighbor deletion) and a
predicate-granularity recompute that made supersession quadratic — both now
regression-tested.
